<p>
Have you ever thought, “What is the big deal about Mona Lisa?” Leonardo Da Vinci used the Golden Ratio, or you may have heard it called “Divine Proportion”, to create this painting. It has been found that the Golden Ratio is repeated throughout nature, to include your very own body. When something falls out of that ratio of 1 to 0.612, you may find yourself saying that there is something just not right with that.(Gross, 2019)
</p>



<p>
Da Vinci was well aware of the Golden Ratio and possibly consciously used it as part of his paintings. (“Leonardo and Mathematics,” 2012)  There have been formulas discovered after the life of an artist that explain why their works became so popular, and were used without the artist being consciously aware. </p>
