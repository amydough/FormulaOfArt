If you have heard of Jackson Pollock, you might have also heard the jokes that refer to his paintings as a random mess. Maybe a joke referring to your toddler creating a “Jackson Pollock” on the wall with his baby food. For many years, no one could explain why Pollock’s paintings were considered beautiful. Those that loved them could only say that there was just something about it. It was quite a scandal! In 1975, almost 20 years after Pollock’s death, Benoit Mandelbrot discovered fractal dimension. Defining this term is almost as complex as defining why you find a Pollock painting attractive. Essentially it is when smaller images of a shape are replicated off of the original shape. (Falconer, 2014)</p>

In 2000, Richard Tayor and his team analyzed Pollock’s paintings using “box counting” to measure fractal dimension. They found fractal patterns in his drip painting and these patterns increased as he added multiple layers over the years. (Taylor, Micolich, & Jonas, 1999)

Perspective and Planar Symmetry in an art work also use mathematical concepts to create realism in an art piece. </p>
