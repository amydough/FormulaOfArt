You may have heard in the past the idea that you either have a logical, mathematic mind, or an artistic, creative mind. What if I were to tell you that you can have both, and more than likely you do have both? Follow along and I will explain what I mean.

What is it that makes something beautiful? Why is that painting worth so much because everyone wants to have it hanging on their wall? Whether you realize it or not, when you are looking at something in nature, or viewing a piece of art, your brain is analyzing it with mathematical functions that apply to beauty.

A lot of these functions apply to things you may have already learned in high school from geometry and trigonometry. Maybe you never took these courses, but that is ok. Your brain has already been created to know and identify them. </p>

<p>Your next trip to an art gallery might give you a new perspective on art, giving you a different appreciation for art and even for math.
